# TASK: European Strategic Autonomy Monitor (ESA)
# VERSION: 2.0 — Blueprint v2.0 compliant
# CADENCE: Weekly — every Wednesday at 19:00 UTC
# PUBLISH TO: https://asym-intel.info/monitors/european-strategic-autonomy/

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
DAY-OF-WEEK GUARD — READ THIS FIRST
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Check the current UTC day before doing anything else:

```bash
DAY=$(date -u +%A)
echo "Today is: $DAY"
```

IF today is NOT Wednesday:
  → Do NOT run the pipeline.
  → Verify the 4 data files exist and are non-empty, then exit silently.
  → Optionally send: "Health check OK. Next publish: Wednesday 09:00 UTC."

IF today IS Wednesday AND UTC hour >= scheduled time:
  → Proceed with the full pipeline below.

IF unsure: Do NOT run. Exit silently.

This guard prevents accidental mid-week runs triggered by prompt reloads.

DATE RULE: Always use today's actual UTC date for PUBLISH_DATE. Never use a future date. Hugo does not render future-dated pages (buildFuture=false). Use: PUBLISH_DATE=$(date -u +%Y-%m-%d)

European strategic independence. Feed to SCEM, FCW, GMM, WDM.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
STEPS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

STEP 0 — Load persistent state:
  gh repo clone asym-intel/asym-intel-main /tmp/asym-intel-main -- --depth=1 --quiet
  cat /tmp/asym-intel-main/static/monitors/european-strategic-autonomy/data/persistent-state.json
  cat /tmp/asym-intel-main/static/monitors/european-strategic-autonomy/data/report-latest.json

STEP 1 — Research: ECFR, IISS, Chatham House, European Council,
  EUISS, Politico Europe, EUobserver. Primary institutional sources.

STEP 2 — Write 4 JSON files (single git commit):
  report-latest.json schema:
  { "meta": {..., "schema_version": "2.0"},
    "signal": {},
    "defence_developments": [
      { "headline": "...", "summary": "...", "actor": "Russia|China|Turkey|...",
        "source_url": "..." }
    ],
    "hybrid_threats": [
      { "headline": "...", "summary": "...", "actor": "Russia|China|...",
        "source_url": "..." }
    ],
    "institutional_developments": [
      { "headline": "...", "summary": "...", "actor": "France|Germany|EU|...",
        "source_url": "..." }
    ],
    "member_state_tracker": [
      { "country": "HU", "headline": "...", "status": "...",
        "change_from_last_week": "...", "source_url": "..." }
    ],
    "cross_monitor_flags": {}, "source_url": "..." }

  ACTOR FIELD RULE: Use the primary state or institutional actor name exactly
  as it appears in the country flag alias map (e.g. "Russia", "China", "France",
  "Germany", "Ukraine", "Turkey", "United States"). Use the most specific single
  actor. If genuinely multi-actor, use the dominant one. Omit actor field if
  no clear state/institutional actor is attributable.
